#NOTE: just type 'make' for instructions.  To setup a personal installation
#of byond (not available to other users on the system), simply type
#'make here'.

#To install on the entire system, change any of the following parameters
#(they should be correct for most systems), su to root, and type
#'make install'.


#Location of BYOND system files.  If you install it in some other location,
#you will need to define the environment variable BYOND_SYSTEM in your
#system profile script and point it to that location.

BYOND_SYSTEM = /usr/local/byond

#Location of executables.  Actually, we only place symbolic links there
#pointing to the real location.  It should be a place in your PATH.

BIN_DIR = /usr/local/bin

#Location of shared libraries.  We put a symbolic link there too.  This
#should be a place where ldd expects to find shared libraries (either listed
#in /etc/ld.so.conf or in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable).

LIB_DIR = /usr/local/lib

#Location of manual pages.  Once again, a symbolic link is used from here
#to the true location of the files.  This allows for easy upgrade/removal
#in the future.

MAN_DIR = /usr/share/man

#If you are installing as root, DreamDaemon can be installed
#suid root, which makes it possible to honor the suid flag
#on dmb files (so they can run as the owner of the .dmb).  This
#is entirely optional.  Uncomment the following line if you
#want that and are installing as root.

#ENABLE_SUID = yes


#A world hosting server has also been included in this package.
#Read about it in host/readme.html.  If you want to host right
#out of each user's home directory (like a typical web hosting
#setup), then host.dmb must be run as root.  You can accomplish
#that either by logging in as root when you start it up, or you
#could make host.dmb suid-root, which will allow non-root users
#to start it up.  The latter option requires that DreamDaemon
#also be suid-root, so you have to answer yes to the question
#above if you answer yes here.

#HOST_SUID_ROOT = yes
